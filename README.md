# 🛍️ Vyapaar-Mitra

**AI-powered hyperlocal commerce without mandatory inventory**
Problem statement: **MU-PS-008 — The Small-Shop Digital Gap · Local Commerce Enablement**

> *"Don't force the shopkeeper to learn software. Make the software understand the shopkeeper."*

---

## 1. Overview

Vyapaar-Mitra connects a customer who needs something *right now* with a shop 200 metres away
that probably has it — over Telegram, in Hindi/Hinglish, by voice, text or photo.

The merchant does not need an app, a catalogue, or a single uploaded product.

## 2. The problem

Every "digitise local commerce" product starts by asking the shopkeeper to upload inventory.
That is exactly where they drop off. A kirana or hardware shop owner has thousands of SKUs,
no barcodes, no time, and no reason to trust that the work pays off. So catalogues stay empty,
and empty catalogues mean the shop is invisible.

Meanwhile the customer's actual question was never about a catalogue. It was:
*"Who near me has this?"*

## 3. Core innovation — commerce without mandatory digital inventory

**Traditional commerce asks:** What products has this shop uploaded?
**Vyapaar-Mitra asks:** Who nearby can satisfy this customer's need?

A merchant is discoverable through:

| Signal | Example |
|---|---|
| Business category | hardware |
| Capabilities | plumbing, pipes, fittings, sealants |
| Location | 200 m from the customer |
| Customer intent | "pipe leak rokne wala safed tape" → Teflon Tape |
| Historical response | this shop usually answers, and usually has it |
| Merchant response | a one-tap YES / NO |

Sharma Hardware has **zero products uploaded** and is still the top match. That is the
entire thesis, and the seed data is built to demonstrate it.

### Why zero-inventory matters

1. **Onboarding takes 30 seconds**, not 30 hours — name, category, location, done.
2. **Day-one value**: a merchant gets real customer requests before uploading anything.
3. **Inventory becomes a reward, not a toll** — merchants who later add stock rank higher.
4. **A "NO" is still valuable** — it becomes demand intelligence for the whole neighbourhood.

## 4. Architecture

```
Telegram  (customer + merchant interface)
    │
    ▼
FastAPI   (backend + minimal HTML auth pages)
    │
    ▼
Business services   (search, matching, demand, khata, inventory, auth, email)
    │
    ▼
MongoDB   (geospatial 2dsphere, aggregation pipelines)
    │
    ▼
AI services
    ├── Sarvam AI  — Indian-language speech to text
    ├── Google Gemini — intent, vision, structured extraction
    └── Groq / GPT-OSS — fast fallback inference
```

**Architectural rule:** Telegram handlers contain *no* business logic. Everything lives in
`app/services/`, so WhatsApp or a web front-end can be added later without rewriting the core.

There is no React and no Next.js. FastAPI serves the handful of HTML pages directly with Jinja2.

## 5. AI architecture

A provider abstraction (`app/ai/base.py`) defines `LLMProvider` (`generate_text`,
`generate_structured`, `analyze_image`) and `STTProvider` (`transcribe`). Business logic never
imports Gemini or Groq directly.

```
Text tasks:   Gemini ──fail──▶ Groq ──fail──▶ GPT-OSS ──fail──▶ honest error to the user
Speech:       Sarvam ──fail──▶ "voice unavailable, please type"
Vision:       Gemini ──fail──▶ ask for a text description
```

Model responsibilities (the cheapest capable model wins — not every task goes to every model):

| Provider | Used for |
|---|---|
| **Sarvam AI** | Hindi / Hinglish / noisy Telegram voice notes |
| **Gemini** | intent extraction, product identification, image understanding, category classification |
| **Groq** | fast fallback inference, query normalisation, lightweight text |
| **GPT-OSS (20B / 120B)** | configurable open-weight provider, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

> **GROQ ≠ Grok.** GROQ is the inference provider used here. Grok is an unrelated xAI model.

**We never fabricate AI output.** If every provider fails, the bot says so.

### Confidence handling

| Confidence | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.80 | direct matching |
| 0.60 – 0.79 | match, but internally flagged uncertain and disclosed to the merchant |
| < 0.60 | ask the customer to clarify (1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ or send a photo) |

## 6. MongoDB architecture

Collections: `users`, `customers`, `shops`, `inventory_items`, `product_requests`,
`merchant_matches`, `demand_events`, `khata_entries`, `auth_tokens`, `sessions`,
`notifications`, `merchant_cooldowns`.

Locations are **always** GeoJSON points — never a bare latitude/longitude pair:

```json
{ "type": "Point", "coordinates": [75.0686, 24.0734] }
```

`2dsphere` indexes on `shops.location`, `customers.location`, `product_requests.location` and
`demand_events.location` let `$geoNear` do the distance work inside the database rather than
loading every merchant into Python. TTL indexes expire `auth_tokens`, `sessions` and
`merchant_cooldowns` automatically.

### Matching algorithm

```
score = 0.30·category + 0.35·capability + 0.20·distance + 0.15·history
```

Radius expands automatically: **500 m → 1 km → 2 km → 5 km** until candidates are found.
Weights and radii are all configurable in `.env`.

## 7. Authentication architecture

Passwords never travel through Telegram.

```
Telegram  🔐 Login / Register
    │  bot creates a cryptographically random token (secrets.token_urlsafe)
    │  stores ONLY sha256(token), single-use, 10-minute TTL
    ▼
https://your-domain/auth/telegram?token=ONE_TIME_TOKEN
    │  server-rendered login/register form (Jinja2, CSRF-protected)
    ▼
Account created/verified → linked to telegram_user_id → signed session cookie
    │
    ├─▶ browser:  "Telegram account linked successfully."
    └─▶ Telegram: "✅ Account successfully connected."
```

- Argon2id password hashing (bcrypt fallback), never plaintext, never in logs or URLs
- Single-use tokens, hashed at rest, invalidated on reuse and on issuing a new one
- Signed, HttpOnly, SameSite session cookies
- Rate limiting on `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/auth/telegram` and on AI operations
- Role-based authorization (customer / shopkeeper / admin)

## 10. Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo> vyapaar-mitra && cd vyapaar-mitra
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in the keys below
```

### MongoDB setup

**Local**
```bash
docker run -d --name vyapaar-mongo -p 27017:27017 -v vyapaar_data:/data/db mongo:7
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
```

**Atlas** — create a free M0 cluster, add your IP to the access list, then
`MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net`.

Indexes (including 2dsphere) are created automatically on startup.

### Telegram setup
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) → `/newbot`
2. Copy the token into `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
3. Get your numeric id from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) → `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_IDS`

### Sarvam setup
Sign up at [sarvam.ai](https://www.sarvam.ai), create an API subscription key →
`SARVAM_API_KEY`. Model defaults to `saarika:v2`, language `hi-IN`.

### Gemini setup
Create a key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) → `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
Default model `gemini-2.0-flash`.

### Groq setup
Create a key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) → `GROQ_API_KEY`.
Default model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.

### GPT-OSS configuration
Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works:

```env
# Groq-hosted
GPT_OSS_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
GPT_OSS_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-20b     # or openai/gpt-oss-120b where supported
GPT_OSS_API_KEY=<groq key>

# Self-hosted vLLM / Ollama
GPT_OSS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
GPT_OSS_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
GPT_OSS_API_KEY=ollama
```

### SMTP setup (optional)
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=you@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=<app password>
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=you@gmail.com
```
Leave blank to run without email — Telegram is unaffected.

### Public URL for login links
Telegram login links must be reachable from the user's phone:
```bash
ngrok http 8000        # then PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://<id>.ngrok-free.app
```

## 11. Running locally

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
# or
python -m app.main
# or the whole stack
docker compose up --build
```

Check `http://localhost:8000/health` — it reports database status and which AI providers are
configured.

## 12. Seeding demo data

```bash
python -m scripts.seed_demo_data --reset
```

Seeds ten shops around `SEED_CENTER_LAT/LNG` (Mandsaur, MP by default). **Five of them have
zero inventory on purpose**, including Sharma Hardware, which is the star of the demo.

To make a seeded shop receive live Telegram requests: open the bot as that shopkeeper, press
🔐 Login / Register, log in with `shop1@vyapaar-mitra.local` / `VyapaarDemo123`, then share
the shop's location.

## 13. Running tests

```bash
pytest                    # unit tests: no MongoDB or API keys needed
pytest -v tests/test_matching.py
python -m scripts.test_pipeline    # full pipeline against a live MongoDB
```

Covered: Haversine, GeoJSON, category matching, capability matching, merchant ranking,
zero-inventory precedence, cooldown configuration, intent validation and clamping, auth token
expiry, password hashing, role authorization, khata arithmetic, demand aggregation output.

**Verification status.** This project was authored in a sandbox without network access, so the
third-party dependencies could never be installed there. Every module compiles, and the
dependency-free suites (`test_geo.py`, `test_khata.py` — 16 tests) were executed and pass. The
suites that import pydantic, bson or httpx have *not* been run yet. Run `pytest` once after
`pip install -r requirements.txt` before relying on them.

## 14. Demo script (2 minutes)

**Setup:** `docker compose up`, `python -m scripts.seed_demo_data --reset`, one merchant
account linked to a second Telegram account with a location within 500 m.

1. **Customer** sends a voice note:
   *"Mere sink ke niche pipe leak ho raha hai, usko rokne wala safed tape chahiye."*
2. **Bot** replies instantly: `🔍 Samajh raha hoon... Nearby shops locate kar raha hoon.`
3. **Sarvam** transcribes → **Gemini** returns `Teflon Tape · hardware · plumbing · 0.94`
4. **Matching** picks Sharma Hardware — 200 m away, hardware, plumbing capability,
   **zero inventory**
5. **Merchant** receives the request and taps **✅ YES**, then types `30`
6. **Customer** receives: `🎉 Nearby match found! Sharma Hardware · ~200m · Teflon Tape · ₹30`
7. **Second merchant** taps **❌ NO** → a `DemandEvent` is written and a 12-hour cooldown is set
8. **`/demand`** shows the aggregate: `Teflon Tape — 18 requests, 11 unavailable`

Closing line:

> Traditional commerce asks: *What products has this shop uploaded?*
> Vyapaar-Mitra asks: *Who nearby can satisfy this customer's need?*

No Telegram handy? `python -m scripts.test_pipeline` prints the same flow end to end, and
`POST /api/test/match` runs it over HTTP.

## 16. Telegram commands

`/start` `/menu` `/help` `/login` `/history` `/khata` `/khata_summary` `/inventory`
`/demand` `/compare <product>` `/category` `/shop` `/admin` `/admin_demand`

## 17. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Bot doesn't respond | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` missing, or another process is already polling the same bot |
| `MongoDB connection failed` | Mongo not running, or Atlas IP allow-list / credentials |
| Login link opens but nothing happens | `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` must be reachable from the phone (use ngrok) |
| "This link has expired" | Links last 10 minutes and are single-use — request a new one |
| No merchants matched | Shops need a location; seed data, then share each shop's location |
| Voice search fails | `SARVAM_API_KEY` missing — text search still works |
| `AI providers unavailable` | No Gemini/Groq/GPT-OSS key configured, or all are failing |
| Merchant stopped getting requests | Cooldown after a NO (12 h), or the shop was paused |
| Emails never arrive | SMTP is optional; blank config silently disables it |

## 18. Future roadmap

- WhatsApp Business interface reusing the same service layer
- Merchant reputation and verified-shop badges
- Multi-merchant bidding with time-boxed offers
- Restock suggestions driven by demand events
- Delivery-partner hand-off (out of scope today by design)
- Regional language expansion beyond Hindi/Hinglish via Sarvam
- Offline-first SMS fallback for feature phones

## 19. Design notes / non-goals

Deliberately **not** built: Next.js or React, a large web dashboard, a mobile app, payments,
delivery management, worker marketplaces, microservices, Kubernetes, Kafka, Celery, Redis, or a
vector database. The interface is Telegram plus a few server-rendered HTML pages. An MVP that
runs on one process and one database is the point.

One more thing the system never does: claim a sale happened. A merchant's YES means
*"I have this in stock"* — nothing more. The customer still walks in and buys.
